You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 802e80c 1st commit with 2 folders

Diggi@Diggi-PC MINGW32 /d/git test ((c97d9f1...))
$ git checkout test-branch

any of your branches:

If you want to keep it by creating a new branch, this may be a good time
to do so with:

 git branch <new-branch-name> c97d9f1

Switched to branch 'test-branch'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/test-branch'.
